# Wavelet-Guided-Spatial-Attention-Transformers
Our model has been trained using Kaggle notebook and evaluated on multiple datasets: 
Malaria cells images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
Blood Cells Image Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unclesamulus/blood-cells-image-dataset
Vehicle Detection Image Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/vehicle-detection-image-set

These datasets were used to assess the effectiveness and generalization of our model across different image classification tasks
